**A modern Data Lakehouse architecture built on a local machine using 100% open-source tools.**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests raw supply chain data, transforms it using dbt, stores it in DuckDB, predicts delivery delays using Machine Learning, and visualizes insights via an interactive Streamlit dashboard equipped with LLM capabilities.
